# np-real-sign-in

Sign in to your real PSN account on a jailbroken PS4/PS5. This payload restores authentic `config.dat` and `auth.dat` from a legitimately signed-in console, writing the account configuration to the system registry so you can use your real PSN account.

## Requirements

- A **source console** that is signed in to PSN and activated (latest firmware retail console, testkit, or devkit)
- A **target console** on lower firmware with a jailbreak
- A way to send ELF payloads to the target console (e.g. netcat, payload sender)

## Step 1: Extract files from the source console

On your signed-in, activated source console, locate these files:

```
/system_data/priv/home/<userid>/config.dat
/system_data/priv/home/<userid>/np/auth.dat
```

**PS4 only** — you also need these two files:

```
/user/home/<userid>/np/account.dat
/user/home/<userid>/np/token.dat
```

`<userid>` is the hex user ID of the signed-in account (e.g. `10000000`).

You can extract these via FTP on a jailbroken source console, or by any other method that gives you access to the filesystem.

## Step 2: Create a system backup on the source console

On the **source console**, create a full system backup via **Settings > System > Back Up and Restore > Back Up PS4/PS5**.

This backup contains the activation state needed for the target console.

## Step 3: Restore the backup on the target console

Restore the system backup onto your **lower firmware jailbroken target console** via **Settings > System > Back Up and Restore > Restore PS4/PS5**.

This transfers the **activation state** to the target console.

## Step 4: Copy config.dat and auth.dat to the target console

After restoring the backup and jailbreaking (if needed), copy the files you extracted in Step 1 to the target console via FTP:

```
/system_data/priv/home/<userid>/config.dat
/system_data/priv/home/<userid>/np/auth.dat
```

**PS4 only** — also copy:

```
/user/home/<userid>/np/account.dat
/user/home/<userid>/np/token.dat
```

Make sure `<userid>` matches the user ID on the target console.

## Step 5: Send the payload

Send the appropriate ELF payload to the target console:

- **PS4:** `bin/np-restore-account-ps4.elf`
- **PS5:** `bin/np-restore-account-ps5.elf`

```bash
# Example using netcat
nc <console-ip> 9021 < bin/np-restore-account-ps4.elf
```

The payload reads `config.dat` for the foreground user and writes all account fields (username, online ID, account ID, email, country, language, etc.) to the system registry.

## Step 6: Reboot

Reboot the console. After reboot, you will be signed in to your real PSN account.

## Building from source

Requires the [PS4 Payload SDK](https://github.com/ps4-payload-dev/pacbrew-packages) or [PS5 Payload SDK](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk).

```bash
# Build both PS4 and PS5 ELFs
make

# Build PS4 only
make build-ps4

# Build PS5 only
make build-ps5

# Clean
make clean
```

## How it works

The payload:

1. Identifies the foreground user on the console
2. Reads `/system_data/priv/home/<userid>/config.dat`
3. Parses all account fields (username, account ID, email, online ID, NP environment, country, language, locale, and various flags)
4. Writes every field verbatim to the system registry via `sceRegMgrSet*`
5. No patching or modification — it purely copies existing `config.dat` data to the registry
